/**
 * This package consist of classes, which solve the task of counting the minimum
 * multiply for 2 numbers.
 *
 * Task: Euclid's algorithm for calculating the biggest common divisor (BCD)
 * of to non-negative integers is based on the next properties of this
 * dimension. Lets m and n are non-negative numbers and in the same time m>=n.
 * So, if n==0 then BCD (n,m)= m, and if n~=0, then for numbers m, n and r,
 * where r - a remainder in division m on n, the par BCD(m,n) = BCD (n,r).
 * For instance BCD(15,6)=BCD(6,3)=BCD(3,0)=3.
 * Calculate the least common multiple. (How Euclid's algorithm can help here?)
